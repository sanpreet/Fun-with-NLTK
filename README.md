# Fun-with-NLTK

### Vision of this code
* To make familiar with different operations which can be performed using NLTK such as word counts, frequency distribution, creating sets, displaying most commom used word (:smile:).  
  1. Please go through different operations of code to understand what I mean to say.
  2. Secondly you can also add your own operation more to play with NLTK :joy:.
## How to run the code
Please download the code file Common_Operation_NLTK.py and two folders which I have uploaded in a directory and run the following command in terminal or Pycharm or command prompt
```
python Common_Operation_NLTK.py
```
Hope you like it and understand the code. Give a :thumbsup:to yourself for such.
